        "# Project: The Meetings task manager extractor\n",
        "Welcome to your hands-on AI application build! Today, you aren't just writing code; you are building a tool that solves a common corporate headache: turning messy meeting minutes into assigned tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🏢 Our Company: TechStream Solutions\n",
        "We are a boutique software development company composed of a cross-functional team of 5 employees (IDs 0–4). To keep the gears turning, we rely on a diverse set of expertise:\n",
        "- Backend Developer\n",
        "- Customer Support\n",
        "- Data Scientist\n",
        "- HR Specialist\n",
        "- Marketing Specialist\n",
        "\n",
        "The core challenge in any cross-functional team is ensuring the right person gets the right task. Today, we will automate that decision-making process by developing a tool that:\n",
        "1. Extract tasks from meeting minutes\n",
        "2. Integrates a **machine learning model to automatically classify which employee should carry out a given task**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🛠️ The Workflow\n",
        "We will follow the professional Machine Learning pipeline to move from raw data to a functional product:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Exploration**: We'll dive into our historical dataset, which contains task descriptions, their corresponding task embeddings (numerical representations of text), and the employee best suited for that specific job.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Training & Comparison**: We will experiment with different \"Brains\" (Classifiers)—from Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests to a custom Neural Network (MLP)—to see which one predicts assignments most accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Deployment**: Your best model will be wrapped into a professional web application that runs directly in this notebook, allowing you to process meeting minutes in real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧠 The Problem\n",
        "Our organization has a historical dataset of tasks linked to specific roles. Manually assigning these is slow and prone to human error. By the end of this project, you will have built an application that can \"read\" a new task and instantly predict which of our 5 employees should take the lead."
