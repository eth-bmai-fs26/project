With balanced classes we don't need to worry about the model favoring one class over others, and plain **accuracy** is a fair metric. If classes were imbalanced (e.g. 90% flights, 5% hotels, 5% cars), accuracy would be misleading and we'd need metrics like F1-score or balanced accuracy.\n",

The `sentence` column holds the original text, `label` is the integer class (0/1/2), and columns `0` through `383` hold the 384 embedding values. The embedding values are small floating-point numbers roughly in the range [-0.15, 0.15], which is typical for normalized sentence embeddings."

We obviously can't visualize 384 dimensions, so PCA (Principal Component Analysis) finds the two directions in that space that capture the most variance and projects every point onto them. Think of it as finding the \"best camera angle\" to photograph a 3D object in 2D — except here we're going from 384D to 2D.\n",

        "- **Overlap between clusters** — Where clusters overlap, those are the regions where the classifier will struggle. Misclassified samples at test time will almost always come from these boundary regions.\n",
        "- **Explained variance** — The axis labels show how much of the total variance each principal component captures (e.g. \"PC1 (15.2% var)\"). Don't be alarmed if these percentages seem low — with 384 dimensions, the information is spread across many axes. Even 10-15% per axis is meaningful.\n",

In more challenging scenarios, the heatmap immediately reveals patterns like \"car rentals often get confused with hotels\" — which would suggest those two classes have similar sentence patterns and might need more training data or better features to distinguish."
