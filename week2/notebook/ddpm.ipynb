    "# 👗 From Noise to Fashion — Image Generation with Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook walks you through building and training an **conditional image generation model** on FashionMNIST: you can tell it which clothing category to generate, and it will create new images of that type from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today you will build the core component of the \"Graphic Designer Agent\" from the full AI-run magazine application. From thin air, you will be able to generate images of clothes by using a model that learns to reconstruct a corrupted image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should feel almost like magic! Keep in mind, though, that due to time and resource constraints we will work on much simpler scenarios. The pipeline you build today is the foundation on which modern state-of-the-art image generation models are built. Those models — such as Stable Diffusion — use the very same approach, but are trained on billions of images across ~256 high-end GPUs for several weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 👗 **Load the data** — Set up FashionMNIST with 10 clothing classes\n",
    "2. 💨 **Forward diffusion** — Mathematically destroy images by adding Gaussian noise\n",
    "3. 🔬 **Visualize the noise** — Watch a clean image dissolve into static, step by step\n",
    "4. 🧠 **Train a score model** — Teach a UNet to predict and reverse the noise\n",
    "5. 🎨 **Generate new fashion** — Sample class-conditional images from pure noise\n",
    "6. 🎞️ **Watch it denoise** — Visualize the full reverse diffusion journey\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll be able to prompt the model for any of the 10 clothing categories — giving you a hands-on look at the core technology behind modern image generation systems."
